Contributions are very welcome!

MinMon is pretty easy to extend. Even if it's just a typo in the documentation, I'll be happy to merge your PR.

If you have an idea for a new check or action please use use the [discussions](https://github.com/flo-at/minmon/discussions) page instead of opening a new issue.
